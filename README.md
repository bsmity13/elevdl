The goal of elevdl is to make downloading elevation data easy.

## Installation

Install the development version from
[GitHub](https://github.com/bsmity13/elevdl) with:

``` r
# install.packages("devtools")
devtools::install_github("bsmity13/elevdl")
```

This package is very small. There is a chance I will merge this with
other functions in another package. Check back here for updates.
