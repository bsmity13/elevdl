<!-- badges: start -->
`r badge_license("GPL-3")`
`r badge_custom("repo status", "WIP", "yellow", "https://www.repostatus.org/#wip")`
`r badge_devel("bsmity13/elevdl", "blue")`
<!-- badges: end -->

The goal of elevdl is to make downloading elevation data easy.

## Installation

Install the development version from [GitHub](https://github.com/bsmity13/elevdl) with:

``` r
# install.packages("devtools")
devtools::install_github("bsmity13/elevdl")
```
This package is very small. There is a chance I will merge this with other functions in another package. Check back here for updates.
